## Exercise:

This repository is designed to practice traversing the DOM with jQuery or so-called "vanilla" JavaScript.

Fork and clone as usual and then
`git checkout jquery` for the jQuery branch, or
`git checkout vanilla-js` for the vanilla JavaScript branch

Detailed instructions follow in the README.md for each branch.
